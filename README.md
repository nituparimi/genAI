This architecture enables dynamic functionality for static websites without traditional server management, handling form processing, AI integration, and email communication seamlessly in the cloud. The serverless contact form solution follows these steps:

A static contact form on the website initiates the process.

When a visitor submits the form, it sends an HTTP POST request to Amazon API Gateway.

API Gateway receives this request and invokes the AWS Lambda function.

The Lambda function, the core of the solution:

Processes the form data
Contains a pre-defined prompt for inspirational quote generation
Invokes the Amazon Bedrock API with this prompt
Amazon Bedrock processes the prompt and generates a unique inspirational quote.

The Lambda function then:

Receives the response from the Bedrock API
Initiates the email-sending process using Amazon Simple Email Service (SES)
Amazon SES handles the email delivery:

Sends a notification email to the website owner
Sends a confirmation email, including the inspirational quote, to the website visitor

Key Components
AWS Lambda: Core logic for data processing and service orchestration
Amazon API Gateway: RESTful API endpoint for the contact form
Amazon Bedrock: AI service for generating inspirational quotes
Amazon SES: Email delivery service
